# WrapContentDemo


Android wrap_content is mostly used for wrapping the content within a view. Either with button or Textview, the content can be wrapped. Iâ€™ve created a demo on [How to Use Android Wrap_Content For Wrapping Contents Within The View](https://www.spaceotechnologies.com/android-wrap_content-tutorial-for-beginners/). 

If you face any issue implementing it, you can contact me for help. Also, if you want to implement this feature in your Android App and looking to [Hire Android App Development Company](https://www.spaceotechnologies.com/android-app-development/) to help you, then you can contact Space-O Technologies for the same.
